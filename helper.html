        <h1> You are a <br> Helper! </h1>

        <p>
            As the name suggests, Helpers embrace a nurturing and resourceful nature, always eager to lend assistance wherever needed. Empathetic, sincere, and warm-hearted, they exude genuine kindness. They are friendly, generous, and self-sacrificing but may resort to sentimentality, flattery, and people-pleasing behaviors. Challenges they face include unintentionally doing things for others merely to feel needed and difficulty acknowledging their own needs. Possessiveness may also arise as an issue.<br><br>At their best, Helpers exemplify unselfishness and altruism, offering unconditional love to others. They radiate a genuine kindness that nurtures and uplifts those in their presence, creating a nurturing environment where people feel cared for and valued.<br><br><br><br>
