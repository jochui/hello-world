    <br>
    REFORMER !</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Reformers are wise and down-to-earth souls, often sought after for their practical advice. Guided by strong ethics and a keen sense of right and wrong, they become teachers, crusaders, and advocates for positive change. They strive for improvement but may fear making mistakes. With their well-organized and orderly nature, they uphold high standards, but this can lead to critical and perfectionistic tendencies. Challenges they might encounter include resentment and impatience.
