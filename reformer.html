    Reformers are wise and down-to-earth souls, often sought after for their practical advice. Guided by strong ethics and a keen sense of right and wrong, they become teachers, crusaders, and advocates for positive change. They strive for improvement but may fear making mistakes. With their well-organized and orderly nature, they uphold high standards, but this can lead to critical and perfectionistic tendencies. Challenges they might encounter include resentment and impatience.

They tend to have practical advice and a strong sense of ethics, becoming sought-after teachers and advocates for positive change, motivating others to strive for growth and make a positive impact on their lives and the world.
